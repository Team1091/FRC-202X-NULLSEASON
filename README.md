# FRC-202X-NULLSEASON
## This is a project for use with a dummy robot, whether it be through a simulator, or an IRL robot. It uses the standard libraries controlled and developed by WPI.

The primary goal of this project is to create a highly abstracted interface for controlling a standard FRC (First Robotics Competition) Robot.
Derived from this we hope to be able to allow even users with a basic level of Java or Computer Science knowledge to interact with a RoboRio and similar hardware.

Should this project actually get off the ground, this project should include a blueprint / design that will allow you, or your team,
to build a simplistic robot that can fully use the capabilities described by this "program"

If your team found this helpful, shoot us an email and tell us! It would mean a lot :)
